"""
Exam Service
============

Core business logic for creating exams and student attempts in ChatExam.

Responsibilities:
- Create exams with generated codes and SEB configuration files.
- Manage student exam attempts and ensure teacher-student linking.
- Keep persistence and validation logic outside Flask routes.

This module is part of the ChatExam service layer — designed for clarity,
testability, and future scaling into API or background services.
